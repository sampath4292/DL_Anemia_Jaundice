# JaunENet: An effective non-invasive detection of multi-class jaundice deep learning method with limited labeled data 

## Abstract
Jaundice, characterized by elevated bilirubin levels and a yellowish discoloration of the eyes, mucous membranes, and skin,
 manifests as a symptom of various diseases such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Conventional clinical approaches 
 for jaundice detection, such as urine and serum liver function tests, are invasive and timeconsuming. This study endeavors 
 to establish a non-invasive, multi-class jaundice detection method that could potentially replace traditional chemical and 
 biological procedures. Leveraging only a smartphone app and patient-supplied photos, this innovative approach aims to streamline 
 the diagnostic process. The study utilizes a considerable volume of open-source, unlabeled skin disease data to facilitate 
 the transfer of knowledge from JaunENet to the task of classifying jaundice images. Despite the challenge of a limited sample 
 size, this method achieves precise recognition of jaundice images. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed 
 approach surpasses existing benchmark models across various metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, area under the 
 curve (AUC), and F1-score, yielding impressive values of 0.9674, 0.9663, 0.9717, 0.9833, and 0.9688, respectively. Moreover, 
 the study introduces a SHAP-based model interpretation technique to elucidate the model's output. This analysis underscores 
 the efficacy of the JaunENet network model and the transfer learning and training framework proposed herein, showcasing 
 their ability to expedite and enhance the classification of jaundice images with efficiency and accuracy.
